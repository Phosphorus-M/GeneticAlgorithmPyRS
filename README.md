# PyGADRS: Genetic Algorithm for Python written in Rust

[PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) is an open-source easy-to-use Python 3 library for building the genetic algorithm and optimizing machine learning algorithms. It supports Keras and PyTorch.

It's a fork of PyGAD written in Rust to be ‚ö°Ô∏èüöÄ BLAZINGLY FAST ‚ö°Ô∏èüöÄ

Check the documentation of the [PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Experimenting :test_tube:

Note that the PyGADRS package is not even close to alpha quality.

Nevertheless, the procedure is here for anyone who wants to experiment with PyGADRS.

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Phosphorus-M/GeneticAlgorithmPyRS.git
```

2. Run the installation script (Require Rust and pip)

```
cd GeneticAlgorithmPyRS
./install.sh
```

3. Run the example

```
python3 test/test1.py
```

If the test is ok you have installed PyGADRS on your computer.

Congrats! :tada:
